# JGraph
##A directed graph implementation in Java

###Getting Started
JGraph is a graph implementation that allows users to solve graph problems by adding nodes and edges to the class then solving the problems using JGraph's built in methods. JGraph supports custom data types as it is built with generics, and it (will) support(s) path finding. (Path finding is currently broken, see issues.)

JGraph is a mutable Abstract Data Type (ADT). JGraph was created to practice creating ADTs as well as avoiding representation exposure. It currently abstracts graphs in adjacency list format, but in the future an adjacency matrix representation will be added to increase efficiency of certain algorithms. To learn more about ADTs click [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) and to learn more about representation invariants and abstraction functions click [HERE](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/11wi/lectures/lect05-af-ri.pdf).

Full documentation for JGraph is specified in the wiki in a javadoc-like format.
